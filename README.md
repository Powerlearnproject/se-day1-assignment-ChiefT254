Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing the software's performance or functionality.
Preventive Maintenance: Implementing changes to improve the software's reliability and maintainability.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

 Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall model is a sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation, and maintenance.

Characteristics:
   Rigid and sequential
   Emphasis on documentation
   Detailed planning upfront
   Less flexible to changes
   Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements

Example: Developing a critical software system for air traffic control where safety and reliability are paramount.

 Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It involves breaking down the project into smaller cycles (sprints) and delivering working software frequently.

Characteristics:
   Iterative and incremental
   Emphasis on working software
Flexible to changes
Strong customer collaboration
Suitable for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements

Example: Developing a mobile app where user feedback and market trends are crucial for success.



When to Use Which
Waterfall: Best suited for projects with clear and stable requirements, where risks are well-understood, and there is a need for strict control over the development process. Examples include embedded systems, medical devices, and large-scale enterprise systems.
Agile: Ideal for projects with uncertain or changing requirements, where customer satisfaction is a top priority, and rapid delivery is essential. Examples include software startups, web applications, and mobile app development.
It's important to note that while Waterfall and Agile are often presented as opposing approaches, they are not mutually exclusive. In some cases, a hybrid approach combining elements of both can be effective.
